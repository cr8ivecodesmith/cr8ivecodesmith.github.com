After my successfull [4 Weeks to Fitness Experiment] I'm driven to keep the new
habit I've formed. No longer will I be bound to the stereotypical
_Programmer's Daily Cycle (1)!_

During my last fitness test I've noticed that running is a whole different beast.
It's not just about cardio endurance _as how I naively imagined it_. And
even though I've somewhat gotten to a point where I've trained my body to get
used to workout pain, it was not enough to get me ready for the high impact that
running brings. It felt like it drains your cardio endurance more when you're
not yet used to the sensation.

This new experiment will now involve running!

So in the coming days I'll plan out a fitness program so that it integrates
running for cardio and utilize more body weight exercises from [YAYOG](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.leafcutterstudios.yayog&hl=en).

#### 12-wk beginner's running program

The end goal is to be able to run for 30mins without rest.

Source: http://www.runningtools.com/planbeginners.htm

It's a progressive run/walk cycle where the number represents the number of
minutes of continuous **r**unning or **w**alking. The idea is to slowly
introduce the body to the high impact nature of running, so shorter cycles with
more repitions are done in the early weeks and then it turns into longer running
cycles with fewer repetitions in the later weeks.

This program is supposed to prepare you for a long-term running discipline.


| Week | Day 1       | Day 2         | Day 3         |
|:----:|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| 1    | 2r/2w (4x)  | 2r/2w (4x)    | 2r/2w (4x)    |
| 2    | 2r/2w (5x)  | 3r/2w (4x)    | 2r/2w (5x)    |
| 3    | 3r/2w (4x)  | 4r/2w (3x)    | 3r/2w (4x)    |
| 4    | 5r/3w (2x)  | 4r/2w (2x)    | 5r/3w (2x)    |
|      | 3r/2w (2x)  | 3r/2w (2x)    | 3r/2w (2x)    |
| 5    | 6r/3w (2x)  | 6r/2w (2x)    | 6r/3w (2x)    |
|      | 3r/2w (2x)  | 3r/2w (2x)    | 3r/2w (2x)    |
| 6    | 8r/3w (2x)  | 2r/2w (4x)    | 8r/3w (2x)    |
|      | 3r/2w (2x)  | 3r/2w (2x)    | 3r/2w (2x)    |
| 7    | 10r/3w (2x) | 8r/2w (2x)    | 10r/3w (2x)   |
|      | 3r/2w (2x)  | 3r/2w (2x)    | 3r/2w (2x)    |
| 8    | 13r/3w (2x) | 10r/2w (2x)   | 13r/3w (2x)   |
| 9    | 15r/3w (2x) | 10r/2w (2x)   | 15r/3w (2x)   |
| 10   | 20r/5w (2x) | 10r/2w (2x)   | 20r/5w (2x)   |
| 11   | 15r/5w/25r  | 15r/3w (2x)   | 15r/5w/25r    |
| 12   | 15r/5w/30r  | 15r/3w (2x)   | 15r/5w/30r    |


After this, I'll probably move on to moar advanced running programs and
incorporate swimming in my routine as well.
