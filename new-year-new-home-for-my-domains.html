        <p>Its almost Christmas and the domains I've registered last year are a few days 
short of expiration. Its time to make a choice!</p>
<h2>GoDaddy - a brief background</h2>
<p>Last year I got myself several nice domains for a very cheap price at GoDaddy. 
I was pretty much new with buying stuff online and I'm a cheapskate and GoDaddy 
sort of handed me that indulgence. You simply search over the internets you'll 
find GoDaddy coupons all over the place.</p>
<p>However, as I learn more about the domain registration and differences between 
each registrar I've kinda regretted that decision.</p>
<h2>NameSilo - a new beginning</h2>
<p>It was yesterday when I started to take seriously GoDaddy's email notifications 
about my domains that are due for expiration soon. As I checked, the renewal 
cost where really high. What I previously got for dirt cheap (~US$3), will 
now cost me about US$14. And I have 4 of them expiring soon!</p>
<p>I was already considering moving away from GoDaddy after all the controversies 
spinning around the company anyway so this only sealed that deal for me. Time 
to hit the internets to search for alternatives.</p>
<p>NameCheap was up my alley at this point, in fact I have 1 domain with them. 
However as I looked further, I stumbled upon NameSilo.</p>
<p>Now NameSilo just clicked with me instantly. Cheap, no upsells, no hidden 
charges, free WHOIS protection, and most importantly registration costs are the 
same as renewals.</p>
<p>So I reloaded my prepaid credit card and went on about the domain transfer 
process. It was relatively straightforward and about 20mins later my domains 
are now happily hanging out on NameSilo.</p>
<p>In case you're looking into transferring your domains or thinking of getting a 
new one, I highly recommend in giving them a try.</p>
<h2>promoted links</h2>
<p>I have here a couple of promotions in case you decide to try them out.</p>
<p>Use this promo code to get a $1 discount: <code>freedollar</code></p>
<p>Or visit their page with my affiliate <a href="http://www.namesilo.com/?rid=4193c40rx">link</a> and make me happy :)</p>
