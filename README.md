[Programmers Are People Too]
============================

My static blog generated with [Pelican] and hosted on [Github]  


## To Do's

- Write a guide on how this site is set up and maintained. I've written a 
more general guide here: [The Way Of The Pelican]. So I'll probably just 
add on to that how-to.
