    <blockquote>
<p>When you say "yes" to others, make sure you are not saying "no" to 
yourself.
- Paulo Coelho</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today I've been reminded of my struggle for having ownership with my work. 
A puzzle that I've finally solved after reaching a crossroad in my career. </p>
<p>I've realized that when you're just doing your job or joined a company for 
the money, you're not only short-changing yourself, you're also doing it to 
the organization. If you're like me, who always makes sure you got your end 
covered so as not to drag people down, you'll probably feel bad about doing 
this intentionally or not.</p>
<p>Recalling my previous work experiences; Yes I was challenged, excited, 
learned and shared new things, met new people, and I grew my skills set. 
But I never felt I owned the things I've done nor the projects I've 
launched. </p>
<p>At some point it just felt mechanical <em>-- input given, output delivered.</em> </p>
<p>No extra-mile. </p>
<p>No flowery, feel good, <em>if-I-blew-this-I'll-feel-like-shit-the-next-day</em> 
effect. </p>
<p>I always ask the question, "To what end am I doing this?". </p>
<p>Usual <em>(and wrong)</em> answer: For the money. </p>
<p>Perhaps I never really identified with the organizations I've joined in the 
past. </p>
<p>Perhaps I didn't get the chance to work on things that aligned with my 
strong points. </p>
<p>But whatever the reason is, once you've realized these things it's time to 
stay true to yourself and others. </p>
<p>Change your attitude or leave the job if you have to <em>(or both)</em>. </p>
<p>Just be sure you're not just doing it for the money <em>-- or you just 
momentarily have to as part of a grander purpose.</em> </p>
<p>Do it for love and passion instead. </p>
<p>A dear friend always reminds me that the money always comes after. </p>
<p><strong>Again:</strong> Don't waste time, it's more scarce than you think!</p>
