    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>I'm Matt and you've just arrived at my nice little empty space in the 
       internets.</p>
    <p>If you used to visit me before and you're wondering where all the
       content went, don't panic. I just moved it here: <a href="http://blog.mattlebrun.com">blog.mattlebrun.com</a></p>
    <p>Perhaps later, I'll put something interesting in this page.</p>
