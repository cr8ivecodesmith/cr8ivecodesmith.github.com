What I 
thought to be just a day of fulfilling &lt;em&gt;"boyfriend duties"&lt;/em&gt;, turned out 
quite amazing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made a realization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you didn't know; dream boarding is when you put visual 
representation of your goals, desires, ambitions, dreams or what have you 
in a piece of card board &lt;em&gt;(best on an illustration board).&lt;/em&gt; The idea is 
that, these images becomes a mantra or a cue. Something that you can focus 
on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the workshop activities were timebound and the board we used is small 
(1/8 illustration board), we were forced to prioritize what to put on the 
board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This got me thinking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the most important goals do I have in the next couple of years or 
the next few months even? Then I realized that what I really need is to 
improve myself further. And how do I do that? Form better habits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe much of what we wanted to achieve in life may just be a byproduct of 
having good habits. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>why you don't need to know everything right away</title><link href="http://mattlebrun.com/you-dont-need-to-know-everything.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-09-18T15:30:00+08:00</updated><author><name>matt lebrun</name></author><id>tag:mattlebrun.com,2012-09-18:you-dont-need-to-know-everything.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Learning and researching about a new technology or problem area is a very 
exciting activity for programmers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiosity, for a programmer, is like an insatiable impulse. An unquenchable 
thirst. You take your time as you browse through one information to 
another. Consuming content after content. This can span from hours to days 
or longer. Your desire to "know more" drives you like a mad man. But when 
you're doing this during the course of a client project this can be a 
problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a href="http://www.searchoptmedia.com/5-reasons-to-try-agile-in-your-next-software-project"&gt;Agile's&lt;/a&gt; 
key principle of simplicity. It gives emphasis on the simplest solution the 
would meet the requirements that best reflects your current knowledge on 
the technology and problem area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying that in this context: 
&lt;strong&gt;You don't need to know everything right away.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust that the deeper you go into the project, your knowledge and 
experience increases as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your clients simply can't afford a prolonged or delayed release and neither 
will you have that sense of accomplishment from actually shipping 
something. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you deal with your insatiable curiosity? &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="agile"></category><category term="productivity"></category></entry><entry><title>hello world! v2.0: reflections on leaving the 9-5 life</title><link href="http://mattlebrun.com/leaving-9-to-5.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-09-17T21:00:00+08:00</updated><author><name>matt lebrun</name></author><id>tag:mattlebrun.com,2012-09-17:leaving-9-to-5.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My recent move to finally join &lt;em&gt;(full-time)&lt;/em&gt; the tech start-up scene made me 
reflect once again on this topic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like I've just stepped into the "unknown abyss" that we call the 
entrepreneurial road where a steady monthly paycheck is out of the 
question. This is quite a big leap for someone who &lt;em&gt;-- like a lot of people --&lt;/em&gt; 
have mouths to feed, debts to pay, and a family to support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;-- again, like a lot of people --&lt;/em&gt; I have plans for the future, 
passions to pursue, a purpose to fullfil, and I'm not getting any younger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I made the jump nonetheless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's easy actually. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just close your eyes, hold your breathe, and brace yourself for the roller 
coaster ride! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so fast friend! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't just went for it. If I did I would've faltered off the bat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was preparing my heart for years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my heart was ready, I've talked to the people I cared about for 
support. Then, when I finally got their &lt;em&gt;(hesitant)&lt;/em&gt; blessing that's the 
time I made the jump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, there's a reason why even a faint sense of responsibility is 
required for this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who care about you are affected the most in every decision or path 
you take. If you care about them too, you won't feel there's any point in 
your undertakings if you don't have them to share your ups and downs. It'll 
be one lonely roller coaster ride indeed. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="startup"></category></entry><entry><title>don't waste time, it's more scarce than you think!</title><link href="http://mattlebrun.com/dont-waste-time.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-07-26T18:30:00+08:00</updated><author><name>matt lebrun</name></author><id>tag:mattlebrun.com,2012-07-26:dont-waste-time.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you say "yes" to others, make sure you are not saying "no" to 
yourself.
- Paulo Coelho&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I've been reminded of my struggle for having ownership with my work. 
A puzzle that I've finally solved after reaching a crossroad in my career. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've realized that when you're just doing your job or joined a company for 
the money, you're not only short-changing yourself, you're also doing it to 
the organization. If you're like me, who always makes sure you got your end 
covered so as not to drag people down, you'll probably feel bad about doing 
this intentionally or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recalling my previous work experiences; Yes I was challenged, excited, 
learned and shared new things, met new people, and I grew my skills set. 
But I never felt I owned the things I've done nor the projects I've 
launched. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point it just felt mechanical &lt;em&gt;-- input given, output delivered.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No extra-mile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No flowery, feel good, &lt;em&gt;if-I-blew-this-I'll-feel-like-shit-the-next-day&lt;/em&gt; 
effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always ask the question, "To what end am I doing this?". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usual &lt;em&gt;(and wrong)&lt;/em&gt; answer: For the money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I never really identified with the organizations I've joined in the 
past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I didn't get the chance to work on things that aligned with my 
strong points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But whatever the reason is, once you've realized these things it's time to 
stay true to yourself and others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change your attitude or leave the job if you have to &lt;em&gt;(or both)&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just be sure you're not just doing it for the money &lt;em&gt;-- or you just 
momentarily have to as part of a grander purpose.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do it for love and passion instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dear friend always reminds me that the money always comes after. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Again:&lt;/strong&gt; Don't waste time, it's more scarce than you think!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="thoughts"></category></entry></feed>
