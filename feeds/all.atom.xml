&lt;a href="http://usesthis.com/"&gt;The Setup&lt;/a&gt; which is a website that features 
interviews of people &lt;em&gt;(mostly geeks)&lt;/em&gt; where they get to talk about what 
they do and then elaborate more on what tools (hardware and software) they 
use to get shit done. I thought, "Hey that's pretty cool.", so I read on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I browsed through one interview to the next I noticed that most 
(perhaps in the 90th percentile) are using Apple computers. Which got me to 
ponder whether this is just another Apple fan site. Thank goodness the 
author cleared this out in the &lt;a href="http://usesthis.com/about/"&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; page. I 
was short of dismissing the site as one and hitting the close button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interview with &lt;a href="http://eric.s.raymond.usesthis.com/"&gt;ESR&lt;/a&gt; was one that 
got me thinking and write this post. Albeit, it was the trigger after a 
spur of collective thoughts that was running in my head as I read on the 
interviews of hackers and programmers that I admire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in the spirit of the &lt;a href="http://usesthis.com/"&gt;The Setup's&lt;/a&gt; ethos, here's 
how my setup...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;who are you, and what do you do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm Matt Lebrun, and I fancy myself as a hybrid programmer/designer. It's a 
work in progress and I strive to reach that ideal everyday. I speak several 
&lt;em&gt;(programming)&lt;/em&gt; languages but I love &lt;a href="http://www.python.org/"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; above 
all. In fact, I'm so crazy about it that I just had to spend a significant 
amount of free time volunteering to our local &lt;a href="http://python.ph"&gt;Python community&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I should put this in a separate about page. But since I'm lazy at 
moment, this will do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;what hardware do you use?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you heard of a programmer who does not own a computer? Yep I'm one of 
them. At least I used to be until a couple of months ago. For a long time, 
I contented myself with company issued computers until a life event forced 
me to buy one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got myself a decent &lt;a href="http://www.villman.com/Product-Detail/Acer_V5-431-10072G50Ma"&gt;Acer V5 431&lt;/a&gt;. 
It sports an IvyBridge Celeron 1007U dual-core ULV processor with internal 
Intel HD 4000 graphics. I also bumped up the pre-installed RAM to 8GB to 
make sure my VMs and numerous browser tabs are well fed. It also sports an 
Ultrabook-ish look that's nice to look at. It also had other nice features 
that I don't want to elaborate more on. Most importantly, it came with a 
price that didn't break the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was happily working on it for a couple of months until the awesome folks 
at &lt;a href="http://www.save22.com"&gt;Save22&lt;/a&gt; got me a laptop of my choosing. I got 
myself a very sexy &lt;a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?cc=us&amp;amp;lc=en&amp;amp;dlc=en&amp;amp;docname=c03508920#N351"&gt;HP Envy 4&lt;/a&gt;. 
I use this as my primary machine now and have lent my Acer machine to my 
sister indefinitely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the mobile end, I use the 1st generation &lt;a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_p1000_galaxy_tab-3370.php"&gt;Galaxy Tab&lt;/a&gt;, 
both as a phone and tablet. I do all sorts of on-the-go stuff with it like 
taking pictures and videos, gaming, journaling, sketching, reading, social 
networking. I even code in Python on it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;and what software?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I consider Vim my wife and SublimeText2 my mistress. As I play around with 
sublime, the more hooked I am. Is that bad?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used NetBeans and Eclipse once when I was teaching myself to develop 
Android apps. Then &lt;a href="http://phonegap.com/"&gt;PhoneGap&lt;/a&gt; is mature enough, and 
there's even &lt;a href="http://kivy.org/"&gt;Kivy&lt;/a&gt;... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I primarily used Chrome/Chromium as my browser of choice, but the latest 
incarnation of Firefox rekindled my love for it. So its my primary choice 
now on both my PC and tablet. I just had to say that tab groups and firebug 
should be default for any web development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gnome Terminator is my terminal of choice. Split, tab, and theme your 
terminal to your hearts content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use VirtualBox heavily and run 1-3 virtual development servers at a time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GIMP and Inkscape are my design tools of choice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shutter for selective screen capture. Very important for work and noting 
things down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LibreOffice and Google Docs for spreadsheets and presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UbuntuOne and Insync keeps my important files in the safety of the cloud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thunderbird organizes my Gmail, Google calendar, and Google Tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skype and Empathy for chatting and office communication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google contacts keeps my contacts available on both mobile and PC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KeepassX keeps my passwords, and I got it synced on both PC and mobile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cr8ivecodesmith"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; more nowadays. Its just a 
more sensible social network, IMHO. My Facebook interaction is limited to 
the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/pinoypug/"&gt;Python Users Group&lt;/a&gt; and 
posting some family photo updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux, specifically Ubuntu as my OS of choice both as my daily driver and 
on my VM dev servers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Galaxy Tab is powered by CM10.1 and it works super fine. JB 4.2.2 and 
kernel 3.x breathed new life to this old but trusty warrior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;what would be your dream setup?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now I'm very happy with my PC. Though I'm still waiting for the day 
where ~1.2kgs, ~0.7mm thick, 500GB SSD, 16GB RAM, ~3GHZ Quad-core CPU, ~2GB 
Dedicated Graphics, ~8hrs Battery, and Fully Linux compatible Ultrabooks 
would emerge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could also use a bluetooth stereo headset with mic that I can use on both 
my PC and tablet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd also wish that Ubuntu could be a bit more up to date with the latest 
kernel and do a rolling release just like Arch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had the budget, I'd get something like a Galaxy Note 2 or Nexus 4. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="thoughts"></category><category term="minimalism"></category><category term="geekery"></category></entry><entry><title>the way of the pelican and the order of silly walks</title><link href="http://mattlebrun.com/the-way-of-the-pelican.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-05-25T18:00:00+08:00</updated><author><name>matt lebrun</name></author><id>tag:mattlebrun.com,2013-05-25:the-way-of-the-pelican.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Once there was boy who wrote magnificent stories about technology and the
internets. He talked about tales of discoveries and adventures, of code and
sorcery, of... &lt;em&gt;well you get the point&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you his story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;the art of blogging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many months he poured all of his energy in an ancient art called 
"blogging".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He learned about the arcane languages called "HTML", "CSS", and 
"Javascript" that is used to invoke the necessary spells to put up a 
"website" that runs inside these puny looking contraptions called 
"servers".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so he wrote one webpage after another. Days went by like a puff of 
smoke. He wrote with so much glee it seemed like madness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, while he was out for a walk, he discovered a magical piece of 
software called a "CMS". He spent quite a while researching and learning 
about it. He learned that in order to wield it one must setup a "Database" 
among many things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This could really improve my blogging techniques!", he thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So off with the old and into the new! He started using the "CMS" and got
absorbed in its power and extravagance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;complexity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many months passed by and his website grew in popularity. Traffic surged 
and things appear to have taken a new direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He became focused on the black arts of getting more mailing list 
subscribers, selling affiliate products, gaining more social network 
followers. Even the topics he chose to write about have become focused 
around these matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also casted one "plugin" after another as the CMS permits its wielder to
extend its power with such spells. All of which are for vanity's sake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually he spent more time configuring than writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;losing purpose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he continues down this new path, the boy started becoming weary. 
Inspite of the lights, glamour and all things shiny, he felt empty. Lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Everything appears to be going well but it all feels wrong somehow...", he
thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a brief moment (about 2 seconds) he remembered the days of old. With 
only a simple parchment he calls a "text editor", he wrote stories of his 
discoveries and adventures and how he would go about it for many hours. 
It was the good times indeed. With nothing but the innocence and the 
passion of sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I've become lost.", he mumbled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so the very next day the boy set off to a journey to find himself once 
more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;the order of silly walks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He travelled for many days. He went from one village to the next. He 
trekked on great plains, majestic mountains, and myterious forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day while he was out for a drink along a stream, he saw a group of 
merry men doing some sort of outlandish dancing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curious about what's going on, he cautiously approached one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What do you call this silly dancing, sir?", the boy asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Dancing?! Preposterous! We are channeling our energies to wield a 
powerful, yet cleverly simple, software called the Pelican.", the man 
replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later he learned that the group was called the Order of 
&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqhlQfXUk7w"&gt;Silly Walks&lt;/a&gt;. They too are 
bloggers like him and gained a cult following of audience. But they 
appeared different somehow. They looked happy, fulfilled, simple to the 
core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;a &lt;del&gt;not so&lt;/del&gt; new path&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I must know their secret!", he thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mustering his strength, he asked the man once more...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You need not ask young man. You appear to have to lost your way and so we 
shall show you the path back your self. We shall teach you the way of the 
Pelican!", said the man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;the way of the pelican&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In this training you shall learn to create good old static websites and 
host it on Github."  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"First things first, I shall assume that you have a Github account, 
git, python, a terminal, and your running Ubuntu. Otherwise, move on and 
learn them some place else then come back to me."  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"With those things prepared let's begin your training."  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fire up your terminal and install VirtualEnv + Virtualenvwrapper  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ sudo apt-get install -V python-setuptools python-dev&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ sudo easy_install --upgrade pip&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ sudo pip install virtualenv&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a virtualenv directory and set your projects directory  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ mkdir ~/.virtualenvs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;$ mkdir ~/Projects&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update ~/.bashrc&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"From here on I shall be using Vim for text editing, but you're free to
use your favorite text editor.", the man reminded the boy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ vim ~/.bashrc&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Add the following text at the end of the file."  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;export PROJECT_HOME=$HOME/Projects&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a Virtual Environment  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ mkvirtualenv pelican_blog&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Then your prompt will turn into something like this..."  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;(pelican_blog) $&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to your Github account and create a new repo for your blog and name 
  it:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;*your_username*.github.com&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Using your &lt;em&gt;username&lt;/em&gt; is important here so that github will know that 
you're trying to create a Github page.", the man warned.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clone it to your local directory  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;(pelican_blog) $ git clone git@github.com:*username*/*your_username*.github.com.git ~/Projects/my_blog&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to your working directory  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;(pelican_blog) $ cd ~/Projects/my_blog&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;(pelican_blog)my_blog $&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install pelican + markdown  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;(pelican_blog)my_blog $ pip install pelican&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;(pelican_blog)my_blog $ pip install Markdown&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a post in markdown  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;(pelican_blog)my_blog $ mkdir .content&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;(pelican_blog)my_blog $ vim .content/my_first_blogpost.md&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You must have the following spell at the top of your file in order for 
Pelican to recognize your post."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Title: hello world&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Date: 2013-05-25 18:00&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Hello world!&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a settings.py&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;(pelican_blog)my_blog $ vim settings.py&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generate the HTML files&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;SYNTAX:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;pelican &amp;lt;input_dir&amp;gt; -o &amp;lt;output_dir&amp;gt; -s &amp;lt;settings_file.py&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;(pelican_blog)my_blog $ pelican .content -o . -s settings.py&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check it out&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;(pelican_blog)my_blog $ firefox index.html&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Push your changes to Github  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;(pelican_blog)my_blog $ git add -A&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;(pelican_blog)my_blog $ git commit -m "The blog has begun!"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;(pelican_blog)my_blog $ git push origin master&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visit your new shiny site  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;(pelican_blog)my_blog $ firefox http://*your_username*.github.com&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;and finally&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several months later the boy has finished his training and with his new 
found enlightenment, he went back home happier for once more the focus of 
his blog is about creating wonderful content. The days of joy went on for 
many years... until further notice.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="pelican"></category><category term="python"></category></entry><entry><title>good habits: the root cause in turning your dreams into reality</title><link href="http://mattlebrun.com/good-habits.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-09-23T15:00:00+08:00</updated><author><name>matt lebrun</name></author><id>tag:mattlebrun.com,2012-09-23:good-habits.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I attended a dream boarding workshop with Mickey last September 22. What I 
thought to be just a day of fulfilling &lt;em&gt;"boyfriend duties"&lt;/em&gt;, turned out 
quite amazing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made a realization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you didn't know; dream boarding is when you put visual 
representation of your goals, desires, ambitions, dreams or what have you 
in a piece of card board &lt;em&gt;(best on an illustration board).&lt;/em&gt; The idea is 
that, these images becomes a mantra or a cue. Something that you can focus 
on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the workshop activities were timebound and the board we used is small 
(1/8 illustration board), we were forced to prioritize what to put on the 
board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This got me thinking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the most important goals do I have in the next couple of years or 
the next few months even? Then I realized that what I really need is to 
improve myself further. And how do I do that? Form better habits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe much of what we wanted to achieve in life may just be a byproduct of 
having good habits. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="thoughts"></category></entry><entry><title>why you don't need to know everything right away</title><link href="http://mattlebrun.com/you-dont-need-to-know-everything.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-09-18T15:30:00+08:00</updated><author><name>matt lebrun</name></author><id>tag:mattlebrun.com,2012-09-18:you-dont-need-to-know-everything.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Learning and researching about a new technology or problem area is a very 
exciting activity for programmers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiosity, for a programmer, is like an insatiable impulse. An unquenchable 
thirst. You take your time as you browse through one information to 
another. Consuming content after content. This can span from hours to days 
or longer. Your desire to "know more" drives you like a mad man. But when 
you're doing this during the course of a client project this can be a 
problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a href="http://www.searchoptmedia.com/5-reasons-to-try-agile-in-your-next-software-project"&gt;Agile's&lt;/a&gt; 
key principle of simplicity. It gives emphasis on the simplest solution the 
would meet the requirements that best reflects your current knowledge on 
the technology and problem area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying that in this context: 
&lt;strong&gt;You don't need to know everything right away.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust that the deeper you go into the project, your knowledge and 
experience increases as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your clients simply can't afford a prolonged or delayed release and neither 
will you have that sense of accomplishment from actually shipping 
something. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you deal with your insatiable curiosity? &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="agile"></category><category term="productivity"></category></entry><entry><title>hello world! v2.0: reflections on leaving the 9-5 life</title><link href="http://mattlebrun.com/leaving-9-to-5.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-09-17T21:00:00+08:00</updated><author><name>matt lebrun</name></author><id>tag:mattlebrun.com,2012-09-17:leaving-9-to-5.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My recent move to finally join &lt;em&gt;(full-time)&lt;/em&gt; the tech start-up scene made me 
reflect once again on this topic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like I've just stepped into the "unknown abyss" that we call the 
entrepreneurial road where a steady monthly paycheck is out of the 
question. This is quite a big leap for someone who &lt;em&gt;-- like a lot of people --&lt;/em&gt; 
have mouths to feed, debts to pay, and a family to support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;-- again, like a lot of people --&lt;/em&gt; I have plans for the future, 
passions to pursue, a purpose to fullfil, and I'm not getting any younger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I made the jump nonetheless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's easy actually. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just close your eyes, hold your breathe, and brace yourself for the roller 
coaster ride! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so fast friend! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't just went for it. If I did I would've faltered off the bat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was preparing my heart for years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my heart was ready, I've talked to the people I cared about for 
support. Then, when I finally got their &lt;em&gt;(hesitant)&lt;/em&gt; blessing that's the 
time I made the jump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, there's a reason why even a faint sense of responsibility is 
required for this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who care about you are affected the most in every decision or path 
you take. If you care about them too, you won't feel there's any point in 
your undertakings if you don't have them to share your ups and downs. It'll 
be one lonely roller coaster ride indeed. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="startup"></category></entry><entry><title>don't waste time, it's more scarce than you think!</title><link href="http://mattlebrun.com/dont-waste-time.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-07-26T18:30:00+08:00</updated><author><name>matt lebrun</name></author><id>tag:mattlebrun.com,2012-07-26:dont-waste-time.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you say "yes" to others, make sure you are not saying "no" to 
yourself.
- Paulo Coelho&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I've been reminded of my struggle for having ownership with my work. 
A puzzle that I've finally solved after reaching a crossroad in my career. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've realized that when you're just doing your job or joined a company for 
the money, you're not only short-changing yourself, you're also doing it to 
the organization. If you're like me, who always makes sure you got your end 
covered so as not to drag people down, you'll probably feel bad about doing 
this intentionally or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recalling my previous work experiences; Yes I was challenged, excited, 
learned and shared new things, met new people, and I grew my skills set. 
But I never felt I owned the things I've done nor the projects I've 
launched. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point it just felt mechanical &lt;em&gt;-- input given, output delivered.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No extra-mile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No flowery, feel good, &lt;em&gt;if-I-blew-this-I'll-feel-like-shit-the-next-day&lt;/em&gt; 
effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always ask the question, "To what end am I doing this?". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usual &lt;em&gt;(and wrong)&lt;/em&gt; answer: For the money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I never really identified with the organizations I've joined in the 
past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I didn't get the chance to work on things that aligned with my 
strong points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But whatever the reason is, once you've realized these things it's time to 
stay true to yourself and others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change your attitude or leave the job if you have to &lt;em&gt;(or both)&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just be sure you're not just doing it for the money &lt;em&gt;-- or you just 
momentarily have to as part of a grander purpose.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do it for love and passion instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dear friend always reminds me that the money always comes after. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Again:&lt;/strong&gt; Don't waste time, it's more scarce than you think!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="thoughts"></category></entry></feed>
