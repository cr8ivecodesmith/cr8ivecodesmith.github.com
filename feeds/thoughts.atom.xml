high time to reflect on all of my experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;tl;dr&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2013 was a year filled with unexpected, yet pleasant turn of events.
A lot of milestones have been reached earlier than expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the long version...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;save22&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last April I joined the engineering team of Save22. My growth as an engineer 
has really took off to a whole new level. I never had a chance to work with an 
engineering team as passionate and awesome. It's contagious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its interesting to note that the company's registered name is BOB FTW, where 
BOB stands for &lt;em&gt;Band of Brothers&lt;/em&gt;. We do live up to the name and its spirit. 
I'm really thankful for all the experiences and friends I've gained there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, I hope to bring in more contribution to the success of our company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;family diner&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've moved into a more cost-effective home/biz place. Its a 2-storey house 
where we've turned the 1st floor into the diner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family food business has been doing well early 2013 however things have 
been quite challenging towards the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, our hopes remain high for this year. My plan is to find management 
seminars usually organized by Hapinoy and GoNegosyo or any other community 
where we can get ideas on how to take the family biz to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;python.ph, inc&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Python Users Group Philippines has come a long way. 2013 is a milestone. 
Together with a group of core volunteers, we've incorporated our small group as 
a non-profit organization duly recognized by the Philippine government and the 
&lt;a href="http://www.python.org/psf/"&gt;Python Software Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our mission: To promote the Python programming language and to facilitate the 
growth of our local community of professionals and enthusiasts while hoping to 
make a small dent of improvement to the Philippine IT industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-founding and running a non-profit organization takes a lot of dedication and 
drive. I'm really lucky to be around this group of awesome folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This organization is very dear to me. Not only because its my first time to 
undertake something like this, but also because its been one of my long-term 
dreams to build a foundation similar to this. In a way, I'd like to believe 
that this is a granted wish from the heavens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;secret projects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2013 served as the breeding ground for the idea behind our secret project to 
solidify. This year the goal is to set the initial stages in motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;padlamat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owning a home is waaay down our bucket list however when an opportunity was 
presented to Ela and I, we just had to take it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ela and I got ourselves a pre-selling studio condo in the Ayala Group's 
&lt;a href="http://www.avidaland.com/Avida-towers-asten.php"&gt;Avida Asten&lt;/a&gt; project in 
Makati. We would've went for a 1-bedroom unit had our budgets permitted. This 
takes a significant cut from our wedding savings fund but in any case, we are 
very happy with this humble abode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're now looking forward to the 2017 turnover of &lt;em&gt;padlamat&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;parting thoughts and on to 2014&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, 2013 has really been the most eventful year yet. Most of the things 
that have happened are but a starting point so I'm expecting challenges to come 
this year. If anything, I'm actually looking forward to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2014 here we go!&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>why you don't need to know everything right away</title><link href="https://mattlebrun.com/why-you-dont-need-to-know-everything-right-away.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-09-18T15:30:00+08:00</published><updated>2012-09-18T15:30:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Matt Lebrun</name></author><id>tag:mattlebrun.com,2012-09-18:why-you-dont-need-to-know-everything-right-away.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Learning and researching about a new technology or problem area is a very 
exciting activity for programmers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiosity, for a programmer, is like an insatiable impulse. An unquenchable 
thirst. You take your time as you browse through one information to 
another. Consuming content after content. This can span from hours to days 
or longer. Your desire to "know more" drives you like a mad man. But when 
you're doing this during the course of a client project this can be a 
problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a href="http://www.searchoptmedia.com/5-reasons-to-try-agile-in-your-next-software-project"&gt;Agile's&lt;/a&gt; 
key principle of simplicity. It gives emphasis on the simplest solution the 
would meet the requirements that best reflects your current knowledge on 
the technology and problem area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying that in this context: 
&lt;strong&gt;You don't need to know everything right away.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust that the deeper you go into the project, your knowledge and 
experience increases as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your clients simply can't afford a prolonged or delayed release and neither 
will you have that sense of accomplishment from actually shipping 
something. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you deal with your insatiable curiosity? &lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>hello world! v2.0: reflections on leaving the 9-5 life</title><link href="https://mattlebrun.com/hello-world-v20-reflections-on-leaving-the-9-5-life.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-09-17T21:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2012-09-17T21:00:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Matt Lebrun</name></author><id>tag:mattlebrun.com,2012-09-17:hello-world-v20-reflections-on-leaving-the-9-5-life.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My recent move to finally join &lt;em&gt;(full-time)&lt;/em&gt; the tech start-up scene made me 
reflect once again on this topic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like I've just stepped into the "unknown abyss" that we call the 
entrepreneurial road where a steady monthly paycheck is out of the 
question. This is quite a big leap for someone who &lt;em&gt;-- like a lot of people --&lt;/em&gt; 
have mouths to feed, debts to pay, and a family to support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;-- again, like a lot of people --&lt;/em&gt; I have plans for the future, 
passions to pursue, a purpose to fullfil, and I'm not getting any younger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I made the jump nonetheless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's easy actually. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just close your eyes, hold your breathe, and brace yourself for the roller 
coaster ride! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so fast friend! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't just went for it. If I did I would've faltered off the bat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was preparing my heart for years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my heart was ready, I've talked to the people I cared about for 
support. Then, when I finally got their &lt;em&gt;(hesitant)&lt;/em&gt; blessing that's the 
time I made the jump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, there's a reason why even a faint sense of responsibility is 
required for this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who care about you are affected the most in every decision or path 
you take. If you care about them too, you won't feel there's any point in 
your undertakings if you don't have them to share your ups and downs. It'll 
be one lonely roller coaster ride indeed. &lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
