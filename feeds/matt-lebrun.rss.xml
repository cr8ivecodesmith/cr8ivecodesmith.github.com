i.e. you use different keys for deployment, personal, company A, company B, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you probably have wondered how to tell git which key to use to manage the
repo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could use the &lt;a href="https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-remote-ext"&gt;git-remote-ext&lt;/a&gt; utility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;cloning new projects&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ git clone &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;ext::ssh -i /path/ssh/key git@github.com %S /gituser/repo.git&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;existing projects&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit the &lt;code&gt;.git/config&lt;/code&gt; file directly or via the terminal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ git remote remove origin
$ git remote add origin &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;ext::ssh -i /path/ssh/key git@github.com %S /gituser/repo.git&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;verifying new remote origin&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ git remote -v

origin ext::ssh -i /path/ssh/key git@github.com %S /gituser/repo.git &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;fetch&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
origin ext::ssh -i /path/ssh/key git@github.com %S /gituser/repo.git &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;push&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

$ git fetch
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Matt Lebrun</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 14 Sep 2016 16:47:00 +0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:mattlebrun.com,2016-09-14:use-different-git-ssh-key-per-project.html</guid></item><item><title>so long 2013, thanks for all the fish!</title><link>https://mattlebrun.com/so-long-2013-thanks-for-all-the-fish.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Another year has been shaved off of my remaining years of existence and its 
high time to reflect on all of my experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;tl;dr&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2013 was a year filled with unexpected, yet pleasant turn of events.
A lot of milestones have been reached earlier than expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the long version...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;save22&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last April I joined the engineering team of Save22. My growth as an engineer 
has really took off to a whole new level. I never had a chance to work with an 
engineering team as passionate and awesome. It's contagious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its interesting to note that the company's registered name is BOB FTW, where 
BOB stands for &lt;em&gt;Band of Brothers&lt;/em&gt;. We do live up to the name and its spirit. 
I'm really thankful for all the experiences and friends I've gained there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, I hope to bring in more contribution to the success of our company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;family diner&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've moved into a more cost-effective home/biz place. Its a 2-storey house 
where we've turned the 1st floor into the diner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family food business has been doing well early 2013 however things have 
been quite challenging towards the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, our hopes remain high for this year. My plan is to find management 
seminars usually organized by Hapinoy and GoNegosyo or any other community 
where we can get ideas on how to take the family biz to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;python.ph, inc&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Python Users Group Philippines has come a long way. 2013 is a milestone. 
Together with a group of core volunteers, we've incorporated our small group as 
a non-profit organization duly recognized by the Philippine government and the 
&lt;a href="http://www.python.org/psf/"&gt;Python Software Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our mission: To promote the Python programming language and to facilitate the 
growth of our local community of professionals and enthusiasts while hoping to 
make a small dent of improvement to the Philippine IT industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-founding and running a non-profit organization takes a lot of dedication and 
drive. I'm really lucky to be around this group of awesome folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This organization is very dear to me. Not only because its my first time to 
undertake something like this, but also because its been one of my long-term 
dreams to build a foundation similar to this. In a way, I'd like to believe 
that this is a granted wish from the heavens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;secret projects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2013 served as the breeding ground for the idea behind our secret project to 
solidify. This year the goal is to set the initial stages in motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;padlamat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owning a home is waaay down our bucket list however when an opportunity was 
presented to Ela and I, we just had to take it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ela and I got ourselves a pre-selling studio condo in the Ayala Group's 
&lt;a href="http://www.avidaland.com/Avida-towers-asten.php"&gt;Avida Asten&lt;/a&gt; project in 
Makati. We would've went for a 1-bedroom unit had our budgets permitted. This 
takes a significant cut from our wedding savings fund but in any case, we are 
very happy with this humble abode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're now looking forward to the 2017 turnover of &lt;em&gt;padlamat&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;parting thoughts and on to 2014&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, 2013 has really been the most eventful year yet. Most of the things 
that have happened are but a starting point so I'm expecting challenges to come 
this year. If anything, I'm actually looking forward to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2014 here we go!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Matt Lebrun</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:mattlebrun.com,2014-01-01:so-long-2013-thanks-for-all-the-fish.html</guid></item><item><title>new year, new home for my domains</title><link>https://mattlebrun.com/new-year-new-home-for-my-domains.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Its almost Christmas and the domains I've registered last year are a few days 
short of expiration. Its time to make a choice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;GoDaddy - a brief background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year I got myself several nice domains for a very cheap price at GoDaddy. 
I was pretty much new with buying stuff online and I'm a cheapskate and GoDaddy 
sort of handed me that indulgence. You simply search over the internets you'll 
find GoDaddy coupons all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as I learn more about the domain registration and differences between 
each registrar I've kinda regretted that decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NameSilo - a new beginning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was yesterday when I started to take seriously GoDaddy's email notifications 
about my domains that are due for expiration soon. As I checked, the renewal 
cost where really high. What I previously got for dirt cheap (~US$3), will 
now cost me about US$14. And I have 4 of them expiring soon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was already considering moving away from GoDaddy after all the controversies 
spinning around the company anyway so this only sealed that deal for me. Time 
to hit the internets to search for alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NameCheap was up my alley at this point, in fact I have 1 domain with them. 
However as I looked further, I stumbled upon NameSilo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now NameSilo just clicked with me instantly. Cheap, no upsells, no hidden 
charges, free WHOIS protection, and most importantly registration costs are the 
same as renewals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I reloaded my prepaid credit card and went on about the domain transfer 
process. It was relatively straightforward and about 20mins later my domains 
are now happily hanging out on NameSilo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you're looking into transferring your domains or thinking of getting a 
new one, I highly recommend in giving them a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;promoted links&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have here a couple of promotions in case you decide to try them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use this promo code to get a $1 discount: &lt;code&gt;freedollar&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or visit their page with my affiliate &lt;a href="http://www.namesilo.com/?rid=4193c40rx"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; and make me happy :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Matt Lebrun</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 21 Dec 2013 12:40:00 +0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:mattlebrun.com,2013-12-21:new-year-new-home-for-my-domains.html</guid></item><item><title>the setup</title><link>https://mattlebrun.com/the-setup.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I was browsing the social networks today and chanced upon 
&lt;a href="http://usesthis.com/"&gt;The Setup&lt;/a&gt; which is a website that features 
interviews of people &lt;em&gt;(mostly geeks)&lt;/em&gt; where they get to talk about what 
they do and then elaborate more on what tools (hardware and software) they 
use to get shit done. I thought, "Hey that's pretty cool.", so I read on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I browsed through one interview to the next I noticed that most 
(perhaps in the 90th percentile) are using Apple computers. Which got me to 
ponder whether this is just another Apple fan site. Thank goodness the 
author cleared this out in the &lt;a href="http://usesthis.com/about/"&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; page. I 
was short of dismissing the site as one and hitting the close button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interview with &lt;a href="http://eric.s.raymond.usesthis.com/"&gt;ESR&lt;/a&gt; was one that 
got me thinking and write this post. Albeit, it was the trigger after a 
spur of collective thoughts that was running in my head as I read on the 
interviews of hackers and programmers that I admire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in the spirit of the &lt;a href="http://usesthis.com/"&gt;The Setup's&lt;/a&gt; ethos, here's 
how my setup...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;who are you, and what do you do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm Matt Lebrun, and I fancy myself as a hybrid programmer/designer. It's a 
work in progress and I strive to reach that ideal everyday. I speak several 
&lt;em&gt;(programming)&lt;/em&gt; languages but I love &lt;a href="http://www.python.org/"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; above 
all. In fact, I'm so crazy about it that I just had to spend a significant 
amount of free time volunteering to our local &lt;a href="http://python.ph"&gt;Python community&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I should put this in a separate about page. But since I'm lazy at 
moment, this will do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;what hardware do you use?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you heard of a programmer who does not own a computer? Yep I'm one of 
them. At least I used to be until a couple of months ago. For a long time, 
I contented myself with company issued computers until a life event forced 
me to buy one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got myself a decent &lt;a href="http://www.villman.com/Product-Detail/Acer_V5-431-10072G50Ma"&gt;Acer V5 431&lt;/a&gt;. 
It sports an IvyBridge Celeron 1007U dual-core ULV processor with internal 
Intel HD 4000 graphics. I also bumped up the pre-installed RAM to 8GB to 
make sure my VMs and numerous browser tabs are well fed. It also sports an 
Ultrabook-ish look that's nice to look at. It also had other nice features 
that I don't want to elaborate more on. Most importantly, it came with a 
price that didn't break the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was happily working on it for a couple of months until the awesome folks 
at &lt;a href="http://www.save22.com"&gt;Save22&lt;/a&gt; got me a laptop of my choosing. I got 
myself a very sexy &lt;a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?cc=us&amp;amp;lc=en&amp;amp;dlc=en&amp;amp;docname=c03508920#N351"&gt;HP Envy 4&lt;/a&gt;. 
I use this as my primary machine now and have lent my Acer machine to my 
sister indefinitely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the mobile end, I use the 1st generation &lt;a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_p1000_galaxy_tab-3370.php"&gt;Galaxy Tab&lt;/a&gt;, 
both as a phone and tablet. I do all sorts of on-the-go stuff with it like 
taking pictures and videos, gaming, journaling, sketching, reading, social 
networking. I even code in Python on it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;and what software?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I consider Vim my wife and SublimeText2 my mistress. As I play around with 
sublime, the more hooked I am. Is that bad?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used NetBeans and Eclipse once when I was teaching myself to develop 
Android apps. Then &lt;a href="http://phonegap.com/"&gt;PhoneGap&lt;/a&gt; is mature enough, and 
there's even &lt;a href="http://kivy.org/"&gt;Kivy&lt;/a&gt;... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I primarily used Chrome/Chromium as my browser of choice, but the latest 
incarnation of Firefox rekindled my love for it. So its my primary choice 
now on both my PC and tablet. I just had to say that tab groups and firebug 
should be default for any web development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gnome Terminator is my terminal of choice. Split, tab, and theme your 
terminal to your hearts content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use VirtualBox heavily and run 1-3 virtual development servers at a time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GIMP and Inkscape are my design tools of choice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shutter for selective screen capture. Very important for work and noting 
things down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LibreOffice and Google Docs for spreadsheets and presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UbuntuOne and Insync keeps my important files in the safety of the cloud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thunderbird organizes my Gmail, Google calendar, and Google Tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skype and Empathy for chatting and office communication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google contacts keeps my contacts available on both mobile and PC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KeepassX keeps my passwords, and I got it synced on both PC and mobile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cr8ivecodesmith"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; more nowadays. Its just a 
more sensible social network, IMHO. My Facebook interaction is limited to 
the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/pinoypug/"&gt;Python Users Group&lt;/a&gt; and 
posting some family photo updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux, specifically Ubuntu as my OS of choice both as my daily driver and 
on my VM dev servers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Galaxy Tab is powered by CM10.1 and it works super fine. JB 4.2.2 and 
kernel 3.x breathed new life to this old but trusty warrior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;what would be your dream setup?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now I'm very happy with my PC. Though I'm still waiting for the day 
where ~1.2kgs, ~0.7mm thick, 500GB SSD, 16GB RAM, ~3GHZ Quad-core CPU, ~2GB 
Dedicated Graphics, ~8hrs Battery, and Fully Linux compatible Ultrabooks 
would emerge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could also use a bluetooth stereo headset with mic that I can use on both 
my PC and tablet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd also wish that Ubuntu could be a bit more up to date with the latest 
kernel and do a rolling release just like Arch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had the budget, I'd get something like a Galaxy Note 2 or Nexus 4. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Matt Lebrun</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2013 23:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:mattlebrun.com,2013-06-11:the-setup.html</guid></item><item><title>the way of the pelican and the order of silly walks</title><link>https://mattlebrun.com/the-way-of-the-pelican-and-the-order-of-silly-walks.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Once there was boy who wrote magnificent stories about technology and the
internets. He talked about tales of discoveries and adventures, of code and
sorcery, of... &lt;em&gt;well you get the point&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you his story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;the art of blogging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many months he poured all of his energy in an ancient art called 
"blogging".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He learned about the arcane languages called "HTML", "CSS", and 
"Javascript" that is used to invoke the necessary spells to put up a 
"website" that runs inside these puny looking contraptions called 
"servers".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so he wrote one webpage after another. Days went by like a puff of 
smoke. He wrote with so much glee it seemed like madness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, while he was out for a walk, he discovered a magical piece of 
software called a "CMS". He spent quite a while researching and learning 
about it. He learned that in order to wield it one must setup a "Database" 
among many things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This could really improve my blogging techniques!", he thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So off with the old and into the new! He started using the "CMS" and got
absorbed in its power and extravagance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;complexity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many months passed by and his website grew in popularity. Traffic surged 
and things appear to have taken a new direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He became focused on the black arts of getting more mailing list 
subscribers, selling affiliate products, gaining more social network 
followers. Even the topics he chose to write about have become focused 
around these matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also casted one "plugin" after another as the CMS permits its wielder to
extend its power with such spells. All of which are for vanity's sake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually he spent more time configuring than writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;losing purpose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he continues down this new path, the boy started becoming weary. 
Inspite of the lights, glamour and all things shiny, he felt empty. Lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Everything appears to be going well but it all feels wrong somehow...", he
thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a brief moment (about 2 seconds) he remembered the days of old. With 
only a simple parchment he calls a "text editor", he wrote stories of his 
discoveries and adventures and how he would go about it for many hours. 
It was the good times indeed. With nothing but the innocence and the 
passion of sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I've become lost.", he mumbled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so the very next day the boy set off to a journey to find himself once 
more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;the order of silly walks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He travelled for many days. He went from one village to the next. He 
trekked on great plains, majestic mountains, and myterious forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day while he was out for a drink along a stream, he saw a group of 
merry men doing some sort of outlandish dancing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curious about what's going on, he cautiously approached one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What do you call this silly dancing, sir?", the boy asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Dancing?! Preposterous! We are channeling our energies to wield a 
powerful, yet cleverly simple, software called the Pelican.", the man 
replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later he learned that the group was called the Order of 
&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqhlQfXUk7w"&gt;Silly Walks&lt;/a&gt;. They too are 
bloggers like him and gained a cult following of audience. But they 
appeared different somehow. They looked happy, fulfilled, simple to the 
core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;a &lt;del&gt;not so&lt;/del&gt; new path&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I must know their secret!", he thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mustering his strength, he asked the man once more...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You need not ask young man. You appear to have to lost your way and so we 
shall show you the path back your self. We shall teach you the way of the 
Pelican!", said the man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;the way of the pelican&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In this training you shall learn to create good old static websites and 
host it on Github."  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"First things first, I shall assume that you have a Github account, 
git, python, a terminal, and your running Ubuntu. Otherwise, move on and 
learn them some place else then come back to me."  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"With those things prepared let's begin your training."  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fire up your terminal and install VirtualEnv + Virtualenvwrapper  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ sudo apt-get install -V python-setuptools python-dev
$ sudo easy_install --upgrade pip
$ sudo pip install virtualenv
$ sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a virtualenv directory and set your projects directory  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ mkdir ~/.virtualenvs
$ mkdir ~/Projects
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update ~/.bashrc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"From here on I shall be using Vim for text editing, but you're free to use 
your favorite text editor.", the man reminded the boy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ vim ~/.bashrc
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;"Add the following text at the end of the file."  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;export WORKON_HOME=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;HOME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;/.virtualenvs&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;export PROJECT_HOME=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;HOME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;/Projects&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a Virtual Environment  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ mkvirtualenv pelican_blog
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;"Then your prompt will turn into something like this..."  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(pelican_blog) $ 
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to your Github account and create a new repo for your blog and name 
  it:  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;*your_username*.github.com  
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;"Using your &lt;em&gt;username&lt;/em&gt; is important here so that github will know that 
you're trying to create a Github page.", the man warned.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clone it to your local directory  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(pelican_blog) $ git clone git@github.com:*username*/*your_username*.github.com.git ~/Projects/my_blog
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to your working directory  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(pelican_blog) $ cd ~/Projects/my_blog
(pelican_blog)my_blog $ 
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install pelican + markdown  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(pelican_blog)my_blog $ pip install pelican
(pelican_blog)my_blog $ pip install Markdown
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a post in markdown  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(pelican_blog)my_blog $ mkdir .content
(pelican_blog)my_blog $ vim .content/my_first_blogpost.md
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;"You must have the following spell at the top of your file in order for 
Pelican to recognize your post."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;world&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;and finally&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several months later the boy has finished his training and with his new 
found enlightenment, he went back home happier for once more the focus of 
his blog is about creating wonderful content. The days of joy went on for 
many years... until further notice.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Matt Lebrun</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 25 May 2013 18:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:mattlebrun.com,2013-05-25:the-way-of-the-pelican-and-the-order-of-silly-walks.html</guid></item><item><title>why you don't need to know everything right away</title><link>https://mattlebrun.com/why-you-dont-need-to-know-everything-right-away.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Learning and researching about a new technology or problem area is a very 
exciting activity for programmers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiosity, for a programmer, is like an insatiable impulse. An unquenchable 
thirst. You take your time as you browse through one information to 
another. Consuming content after content. This can span from hours to days 
or longer. Your desire to "know more" drives you like a mad man. But when 
you're doing this during the course of a client project this can be a 
problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a href="http://www.searchoptmedia.com/5-reasons-to-try-agile-in-your-next-software-project"&gt;Agile's&lt;/a&gt; 
key principle of simplicity. It gives emphasis on the simplest solution the 
would meet the requirements that best reflects your current knowledge on 
the technology and problem area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying that in this context: 
&lt;strong&gt;You don't need to know everything right away.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust that the deeper you go into the project, your knowledge and 
experience increases as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your clients simply can't afford a prolonged or delayed release and neither 
will you have that sense of accomplishment from actually shipping 
something. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you deal with your insatiable curiosity? &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Matt Lebrun</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 18 Sep 2012 15:30:00 +0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:mattlebrun.com,2012-09-18:why-you-dont-need-to-know-everything-right-away.html</guid></item><item><title>hello world! v2.0: reflections on leaving the 9-5 life</title><link>https://mattlebrun.com/hello-world-v20-reflections-on-leaving-the-9-5-life.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;My recent move to finally join &lt;em&gt;(full-time)&lt;/em&gt; the tech start-up scene made me 
reflect once again on this topic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like I've just stepped into the "unknown abyss" that we call the 
entrepreneurial road where a steady monthly paycheck is out of the 
question. This is quite a big leap for someone who &lt;em&gt;-- like a lot of people --&lt;/em&gt; 
have mouths to feed, debts to pay, and a family to support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;-- again, like a lot of people --&lt;/em&gt; I have plans for the future, 
passions to pursue, a purpose to fullfil, and I'm not getting any younger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I made the jump nonetheless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's easy actually. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just close your eyes, hold your breathe, and brace yourself for the roller 
coaster ride! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so fast friend! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't just went for it. If I did I would've faltered off the bat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was preparing my heart for years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my heart was ready, I've talked to the people I cared about for 
support. Then, when I finally got their &lt;em&gt;(hesitant)&lt;/em&gt; blessing that's the 
time I made the jump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, there's a reason why even a faint sense of responsibility is 
required for this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who care about you are affected the most in every decision or path 
you take. If you care about them too, you won't feel there's any point in 
your undertakings if you don't have them to share your ups and downs. It'll 
be one lonely roller coaster ride indeed. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Matt Lebrun</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 17 Sep 2012 21:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:mattlebrun.com,2012-09-17:hello-world-v20-reflections-on-leaving-the-9-5-life.html</guid></item></channel></rss>
