I attended a dream boarding workshop with Mickey last September 22. What I 
thought to be just a day of fulfilling _"boyfriend duties"_, turned out 
quite amazing. 

I made a realization. 

In case you didn't know; dream boarding is when you put visual 
representation of your goals, desires, ambitions, dreams or what have you 
in a piece of card board _(best on an illustration board)._ The idea is 
that, these images becomes a mantra or a cue. Something that you can focus 
on. 

Since the workshop activities were timebound and the board we used is small 
(1/8 illustration board), we were forced to prioritize what to put on the 
board. 

This got me thinking. 

What are the most important goals do I have in the next couple of years or 
the next few months even? Then I realized that what I really need is to 
improve myself further. And how do I do that? Form better habits. 

Maybe much of what we wanted to achieve in life may just be a byproduct of 
having good habits.
