## How I started

I was already doing my 1-year of calisthenics conditioning but I got to the point where it was hard to progress so I thought losing some body fat and weight would help.

Dieting is an obvious path but I'm not a big fan of restrictive and expensive diets. Those things just doesn't stick.

At about June or July I read about the idea of intermittent fasting or *IF*. I researched articles about its practice and benefits. It piqued my interest and I started doing 16hr fasts.

The idea is to give yourself a feeding window of 8hrs while you fast for the next 16hrs. It was very challenging at first and it took a lot of discipline. I had to experiment and vary my practice over the oncoming months. I also gave myself days off of fasting.

This made me lose quite bit of weight and body fat but retained the muscle gains during my workouts.

I kept on progressing in my calisthenics workouts. I participated in a few trail runs and also picked up wall climbing.

In January 2016, when I started, I was about 66kgs at 19% bodyfat. My waistline was about 87cm. My weight would've spiked to about 68kgs on some periods.

About 10 months later, October 2016, I weigh 59kgs with 14% bodyfat and my waistline is 77cm.

I never felt weak and I didn't get sick during this period even when people around me started getting sick. I never took multivitamins though I still took my calamansi power drink occasionally.

So by this time, I'm convinced that exercise and fasting is a good way to get strong and healthy.



## What is fasting?



## Benefits of fasting



## Why am I fasting

-   Lose those extraneous fat store
-   Train my body to prefer fats for energy instead of sugar
-   Detoxify
-   Challenge myself
-   It's healthy



## Latest experiment: The 2-day fast

I originally planned this out to be a 1-day fast but at some point I just decided to push myself a little more.



### Day 0

**November 8, 2016**

My last meal was around 4:00pm. I ate the Korean bento at our usual place so it's a big meal.

The hunger pangs in the evening we're pretty strong around the time I usually crave for dinner. After ignoring it for a while, it went away.

When I got home from work around 8pm, I did my usual workout. This did not affect my performance as it's only been 4hrs since my last meal.

I did get hunger pangs again around 10pm or so. I just drank water and ignored it.

I continued reading the [book][1]. Here I've read how you're body starts to tap on your fat when it has fully depleted your glycogen stores after about 24-36 hours of fasting.

I've also noted that what you can _drink_ during fasting:

-   water
-   coffee
-   tea
-   bone broth *(aka: medyas soup)*



### Day 1

**November 9, 2016**

When I woke up I did feel a bit hungry. I just drank water.

At this point I was thinking I'll end my fast by 4pm to complete a 1 day fast.

When I got to the office around 10am, I made myself some coffee and proceeded to work. I remembered being curious about bone broth and research what it does and how to make one. Apparently its one of the most nutritious superfoods out there. It has the nutrients you need that you're body can't produce.

Today the hunger pangs were not so bad so I thought maybe I can push myself a bit more for another day. I am even considering a 3-day fast.

During the evening I started feeling cold in my hands and feet. You know that feeling when you're definitely low on sugar. I got excited about this as this might be because I've depleted my glycogen stores!

After work, I went to buy some beef kneecap stocks to make bone broth with.

Back home I researched a bit more on how to make one quickly. Classical bone broths take anywhere from 24-48 hours to make. I simply don't have that time, so this is how I made mine:

-   Put the stock in the sauce pan and put enough water to cover everything.
-   Bring it to boil the lower the heat to let it simmer for 20mins. This process is called blanching.
-   Drain the water and replace with another set enough to cover everything.
-   Bring it to boil then lower the heat and let it simmer for 2hrs. I added some rosemary and italian spices to mine to make it a little interesting.
-   When it's done, pour some on a mug or bowl. Preferably, strain the spices. Put pepper and salt to taste. Enjoy!
-   The remainder of the soup and stock can be stored in a sealed container in the fridge.



What I would've done differently with my bone broth:

-   I would've added a few tablespoons of vinegar after blanching. Apparently this helps extract the nutrients better.



I also took some multivitamins before going to bed.



### Day 2

**November 10, 2016**

I woke up feeling good today. Not hungry at all. I just drank my usual morning glass of water.

Today at the office was filled with meetings so I missed my morning coffee. Consequently I developed some light headache towards the afternoon due to the caffeine withdrawal.

While there were some hunger pangs, they're pretty minimal and I have already gotten used to it by this time.

By around 2pm, I've decided I will be ending my fast. I'll reserve the 3-day fast for another time so by around 4pm I drank some coffee and went out to have my ... *breakfast!*

I was contemplating to get a 2pc Chicken Joy but I went to Maria's instead and ordered a Pinakbet with Lechon Kawali. You would've thought I must be dying of hunger by now. I wasn't.

Normally I found Maria's serving sizes pretty big and I still found it pretty big even after 48hrs of not eating anything. I was full in no time. That was a very satisfying meal! I can taste all the flavors and really took time to appreciate my food.

After that, I went to McDonald's to order some shake fries with garlic butter flavor. I ate it back at the office. Normally I would enjoy the flavoring and the fries but somehow the artificial flavor left a bad after taste in my tongue.

I've also observed that I was not necessarily hungry all the time. Instead, my hunger pangs only triggers around the same I usually eat.

In the evening, I indulged myself with some peanut butter. Okay, a lot of peanut butter.



## What next?

I want to experiment next with 24hr fasts for a week or even try the 3-day fast while continuing with my workouts.
