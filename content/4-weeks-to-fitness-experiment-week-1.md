Well I did say I'll *try* to give a weekly update. Anyway no excuses here. 

So I started the program that I talked about previously last January 6 so that 
it falls on a Monday. I was very excited to get my first week rolling.

## week 1 experience

As with any self-respecting fitness program, session 1 was more for getting a 
good gauge of your fitness level. So I'll have my self some nice initial 
statistics of how bad my shape is from the start.

In respect to the people who created the program I was following, I wouldn't 
get into details of the exercises I did. The exercises are free though, its 
just that the [Fitness Blender](http://www.fitnessblender.com) team compiled 
and selected videos from their website to turn it into a proper fitness 
program.

Week 1 went smoothly.
