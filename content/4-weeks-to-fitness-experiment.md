One of my key goals for this year is to get in to the habit of keeping myself 
healthy. I believe its in our best interest as software engineers to have a 
balanced lifestlye to ensure that we are always working to the best of our 
abilities.

Since April of last year I've started feeling my way towards adding regular 
exercises as part of my weekly activities. I make sure that I do something to 
get my blood pumping at least once a week. While I've not been emperically 
tracking the effects of these efforts, It just feels good to get some 
adrenaline rush every now and then.

On a side note, my body fat percentage did became normal which was a first!

Anyway, I decided to take things up a notch for this month in the efforts of 
making this habit stick.

I'll be following a 
[4-week program](http://www.lulu.com/shop/daniel-segars-and-kelli-segars/low-impact-4-week-fat-loss-program-for-beginners/ebook/product-21250586.html) 
set up by the awesome folks at [Fitness Blender](http://www.fitnessblender.com/).

I'll be doing a weekly update of my progress here and see how it goes.
