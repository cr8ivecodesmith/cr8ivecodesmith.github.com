The stats I'm showing is basically my stats at the start of the week. Or putting
it in another way, its the stats that resulted from my previous week's effort.

Wasn't able to get the upper body workout experience properly because I've got 
no equipment. I'm seriousy considering getting exercise bands as their more 
portable and easily stored than a set of dumbells so I can maximize their 
benefits. They're best to best for building tone and muscle endurance.

## week 2 experience

My week 2 workout actually started *officially* on the 3rd week of January because 
I got inflicted with the flu on the second week. So I guess this 4-week program 
will have to span upto the 1st week of February.

Dramatic weight loss - probably water weight?
Developed toned legs. Quads and calves are definitely more defined.
Pilates exercises are crazy difficult.

## week 2 stats *(Jan 20-24, 2014)*

Weight: 65.7kg  
Neck: 36.7cm  
Waist: 87.5cm
